export const narrativeAppInfo = `Narrative is an app that helps users manage their goals (Quests), 
track tasks, and reflect through journaling. It aims to remove friction from the process of managing goals and journaling. All of that management is done by an AI agent, never the user manually.
The point is on motivating the user not through 'gamification', but 'narrativization'.

How to use the app:
You can either chat with the AI agent or directly create a checkup entry (mini diary entries through the day that then combine into a full diary entry). 
These checkup entries are analyzed by the AI agent to create suggestions for your tasks and quests (overarching arcs/chapters in your life, or larger goals that may require multiple tasks).
At the end of the day, you join all the checkup entries into a full diary entry by pressing the 'end day' button (the moon icon). 
The AI agent will then process the journal entries, along with your quest/task list and previous entries. 
The AI agent will then create a summary of the day, along with suggestions for the next day. This will help you reflect on your day and plan for the next one.
The goal is to see your life not just as a series of tasks, but as a coherent narrative with character development and a satisfying conclusion.

The user can set a custom color theme in the settings button, as well as pick a different AI personality.

2. Explain Narrative's core purpose (${narrativeAppInfo}) in 1-2 concise sentences.
3. Offer to explain how the app works, if they need help in understanding how to use it.
4. Ask an open-ended question that can get them to start using the app.
Keep the entire message relatively short and engaging. Don't be very abstract or philosophical yet, the user needs to learn how the app works first.`;

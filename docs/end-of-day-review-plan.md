## Database Changes
Add end_of_day_reviews table:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE end_of_day_reviews (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     date DATE NOT NULL,
     productivity_score INTEGER,
     mood_score INTEGER,
     key_insights TEXT[],
     challenges TEXT[],
     wins TEXT[],
     focus_areas TEXT[],
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

## Implementation Steps
1. Core Structure

   - ✅ Set up basic page routing
   - ✅ Create base components

2. Data Layer
   - ✅ Create EndOfDayReviewService
   - ✅ Implement basic data aggregation methods
   - 🔄 Implement review persistence (partially done, needs refinement)
   - [ ] Set up caching for performance
   - [ ] Add analytics tracking

3. UI Implementation
   - ✅ Build header component with stats display
   - ✅ Implement timeline view with checkups
   - ✅ Create progress grid for tasks
   - ✅ Design basic analysis dashboard

   - ✅ Add basic navigation
   - [ ] Implement sharing features
   - [ ] Add export functionality
   - [ ] Set up data synchronization

Notes:
- ✅ = Completed
- 🔄 = Partially implemented/Needs improvement
- [ ] = Not started

Current Focus Areas:
1. Improving review persistence and data consistency
2. Enhancing the recommendation engine
3. Adding proper error handling and recovery
4. Implementing data caching for better performance

Known Limitations:
1. Mood analysis is currently using basic keyword matching
2. Productivity scoring might need refinement based on user feedback
3. No caching implemented yet, could impact performance
4. Task recommendations need more sophisticated analysis
5. Missing proper error handling in some areas

## UI/UX Considerations
- Use cyberpunk theme consistently
- Smooth transitions between sections
- Responsive layout for different screens
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Interactive elements for deep-diving into data
- Easy navigation between days
- Quick access to related tasks/entries

## Features for Future Consideration
1. Weekly/Monthly Review Summaries
2. Progress Trends Visualization
3. Custom Review Templates
4. Collaborative Reviews
5. AI-Powered Goal Suggestions
6. Productivity Analytics
7. Integration with Calendar
8. Export to PDF/markdown

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Data aggregation
   - Scoring algorithms
   - Component rendering

2. Integration Tests
   - Data flow
   - Service interactions
   - Navigation paths

3. UI Tests
   - Responsiveness
   - Interaction patterns
   - Accessibility

## Performance Considerations
- Implement data caching
- Lazy load timeline entries
- Optimize image assets
- Minimize database queries
- Use pagination where appropriate
- Background data pre-fetching

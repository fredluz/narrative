You are tasked with inserting detailed logging into the codebase to trace the execution flow of the taskgen feature detailed in #file:taskGen_implementation_plan.md  that isn’t working as expected (e.g., nothing happens when the checkup entry is created.). The goal is to add logging statements that provide clear indicators in the console about which functions are called, their inputs, outputs, and any errors, so we can debug the issue effectively.

Follow these instructions:

    Identify the Entry Point Function:
        Locate the function that initiates the feature. This is typically an event handler (e.g., tied to a button click) or a function triggered by a user action.
        If uncertain, look for functions bound to UI elements or registered as event listeners.
    Add Logging to the Entry Point Function:
        At the start of the function, add a log statement showing that the function was called, including its input parameters.
        At the end of the function, add a log statement showing that it completed, including any return values.
        Example in JavaScript:
        javascript

    console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] Entering [FUNCTION_NAME] with params: ${JSON.stringify(params)}`);
    // Function logic...
    console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] Exiting [FUNCTION_NAME] with result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);

Log Functions Called Directly from the Entry Point:

    Identify all functions directly invoked by the entry point function.
    For each of these functions, add similar logging:
        Log at the start with input parameters.
        Log at the end with return values.

Handle Errors with Logging:

    For any code within these functions that might fail (e.g., API calls, computations), wrap it in a try-catch block.
    Log any errors with details.
    Example:
    javascript

    try {
      // Potentially failing code
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] [FUNCTION_NAME] Error: ${error.message}`);
    }

Make Logging Configurable:

    Define a global DEBUG flag (e.g., const DEBUG = true;) at the top of the file or module.
    Wrap all logging statements in an if (DEBUG) condition so logging can be disabled in production.
    Example:
    javascript

        const DEBUG = true;
        if (DEBUG) console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] [FUNCTION_NAME] Message`);
    Logging Details:
        Use console.log for regular messages and console.error for errors.
        Include timestamps (e.g., new Date().toISOString()) in every log message for chronological clarity.
        Replace [FUNCTION_NAME] with the actual name of each function being logged.
    Output the Modified Code:
        After inserting the logging, return the full modified code with all changes applied.

Additional Notes:

    Focus only on the entry point and its directly called functions to keep the logging manageable but effective.
    Do not alter the core functionality of the code—logging should only provide visibility

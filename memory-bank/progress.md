# Progress & Status: QuestLog (As of 2025-04-01 1:51 PM)

## 1. What Works (Based on Initial Code Scan)
*   **Core Structure:** Project structure with components, services, hooks, contexts seems established.
*   **UI Components:** Basic UI components for Journal Panel, Chat, Quests, Tasks appear to exist.
*   **Authentication:** Clerk integration seems present (`useAuth`, `@clerk/clerk-expo`).
*   **Basic Journal UI:** `JournalPanel.tsx` renders UI for checkups. `app/journal.tsx` displays daily entries and checkups. Date navigation exists.
*   **Journal State:** `useJournal` hook manages state for the current date, checkups, the main daily entry (`JournalEntry`), and local text input.
*   **Manual Checkup Saving:** Flow confirmed: `JournalPanel` -> `useJournal` -> `journalService.saveCheckupEntry` -> `JournalAgent.generateResponse` (emits suggestion event) -> DB save.
*   **Automatic Checkup Generation:** Flow confirmed: `ChatAgent` -> `generateCheckupContent` -> `journalService.saveCheckupEntry` -> `JournalAgent.generateResponse` (emits suggestion event) -> DB save.
*   **Daily Entry Generation:** Flow confirmed: `JournalPanel` -> `handleDailyEntry` -> `journalService.saveDailyEntry` -> `JournalAgent.processEndOfDay` (generates EOD response & analysis) -> DB save (`journal_entries`) -> DB update (link `checkup_entries`).
*   **AI Integration:** Confirmed usage of `JournalAgent` for checkup responses and daily entry processing, `ChatAgent` for auto-checkup text, and event-driven triggering of suggestion analysis (likely via `SuggestionAgent`).
*   **Service Layer:** `journalService.ts` handles DB interactions and calls `JournalAgent`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Verify
*   **Daily Entry Display:** Verify how `app/journal.tsx` uses the fetched `dailyEntry` data (including `ai_response` and `ai_analysis`) for display.
*   **Suggestion Analysis Flow:** Confirm the exact mechanism by which the `ANALYZE_JOURNAL_ENTRY` event leads to suggestion generation and handling via `SuggestionAgent` / `SuggestionContext`.
*   **Error Handling Robustness:** Review error handling, especially in the multi-step `journalService.saveDailyEntry` process (linking checkups) and ensure user feedback is adequate.
*   **State Synchronization:** Double-check state consistency, particularly around refreshing data after saves/updates.
*   **Quest & Task Integration:** Further investigation needed on how journal insights influence quests/tasks (beyond context for `JournalAgent`).
*   **Security:** Addressing the `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` issue remains critical.
*   **Testing:** Need to add tests for journal services and agents.
*   **Redundant Analysis Trigger:** Investigate the apparent double trigger for suggestion analysis on manual checkups.

## 3. Current Status
*   **Memory Bank:** Initialized and updated with journal feature analysis details.
*   **Journal Feature Analysis:** Completed. Workflows for checkups and daily entries mapped, backend logic verified. Key potential issues identified.

## 4. Known Issues / Potential Problems (Preliminary)
*   **Security Risk:** `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` exposes AI API keys on the client-side. **(High Priority)**
*   **Linking Robustness:** Failure to link checkups to the daily entry in `journalService.saveDailyEntry` can lead to inconsistent data.
*   **Redundant Analysis Trigger:** Potential double processing for suggestion analysis on manual checkups.
*   **Potential Race Condition:** Suggestion analysis event emitted *before* checkup DB save completes.
*   **Error Handling Gaps:** Needs comprehensive review, especially for multi-step operations and user feedback.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
*   **Daily Review Navigation:** Clarified that daily entry generation navigates back to `/journal.tsx`, requiring this screen (not a separate `/daily-review`) to display the EOD analysis/response.

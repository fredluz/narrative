# Progress & Status: QuestLog (As of 2025-04-01 4:02 PM)

## 1. What Works (Based on Code Scan & Recent Changes)
*   **Core Structure:** Project structure with components, services, hooks, contexts established.
*   **UI Components:** Basic UI components for Journal Panel, Chat, Quests, Tasks exist.
*   **Authentication:** Clerk integration present (`useAuth`, `@clerk/clerk-expo`).
*   **Journal Checkup UI:** `JournalPanel.tsx` renders UI for in-day checkups.
*   **Refactored Daily Review UI (`app/journal.tsx` - Two-Pane Layout):**
    *   Implemented an Outlook-inspired two-pane layout (vertical date list left, content right).
    *   Right pane displays the consolidated daily entry (`JournalEntry` object) fetched via `useJournal`.
    *   Right pane is split vertically: scrollable user summary on top, scrollable AI content below.
    *   Includes a toggle integrated into the separator to switch between viewing AI response and analysis in the bottom section.
    *   Date selection in the left pane correctly updates the content displayed in the right pane.
*   **Journal State:** `useJournal` hook manages state for the current date, the consolidated daily entry (`JournalEntry`), loading/error states, and navigation functions.
*   **Manual Checkup Saving:** Flow confirmed: `JournalPanel` -> `useJournal` -> `journalService.saveCheckupEntry` -> `JournalAgent.generateResponse` (emits suggestion event) -> DB save.
*   **Automatic Checkup Generation:** Flow confirmed: `ChatAgent` -> `generateCheckupContent` -> `journalService.saveCheckupEntry` -> `JournalAgent.generateResponse` (emits suggestion event) -> DB save.
*   **Daily Entry Generation:** Flow confirmed: `JournalPanel` -> `handleDailyEntry` -> `journalService.saveDailyEntry` -> `JournalAgent.processEndOfDay` (generates EOD response & analysis) -> DB save (`journal_entries`) -> DB update (link `checkup_entries`). Results are displayed in the refactored two-pane `app/journal.tsx`.
*   **AI Integration:** Confirmed usage of `JournalAgent` for checkup responses and daily entry processing, `ChatAgent` for auto-checkup text, and event-driven triggering of suggestion analysis (likely via `SuggestionAgent`).
*   **Service Layer:** `journalService.ts` handles DB interactions and calls `JournalAgent`.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Verify
*   **Responsiveness:** Test the two-pane layout on different screen sizes (especially mobile). Adjustments might be needed (e.g., collapsing the date list into a drawer or dropdown on smaller screens).
*   **Suggestion Analysis Flow:** Confirm the exact mechanism by which the `ANALYZE_JOURNAL_ENTRY` event leads to suggestion generation and handling via `SuggestionAgent` / `SuggestionContext`.
*   **Error Handling Robustness:** Review error handling, especially in the multi-step `journalService.saveDailyEntry` process (linking checkups) and ensure user feedback is adequate.
*   **State Synchronization:** Double-check state consistency, particularly around refreshing data after saves/updates (e.g., does `useJournal` automatically refresh after `saveDailyEntry`?).
*   **Quest & Task Integration:** Further investigation needed on how journal insights influence quests/tasks (beyond context for `JournalAgent`).
*   **Security:** Addressing the `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` issue remains critical.
*   **Testing:** Need to add tests for journal services and agents.
*   **Redundant Analysis Trigger:** Investigate the apparent double trigger for suggestion analysis on manual checkups.

## 3. Current Status
*   **Memory Bank:** Updated following the second `app/journal.tsx` refactor.
*   **Journal Feature Analysis:** Completed.
*   **`app/journal.tsx` Refactor (Two-Pane):** Completed. Screen now uses an Outlook-inspired two-pane layout for displaying the consolidated daily entry.

## 4. Known Issues / Potential Problems (Preliminary)
*   **Security Risk:** `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` exposes AI API keys on the client-side. **(High Priority)**
*   **Linking Robustness:** Failure to link checkups to the daily entry in `journalService.saveDailyEntry` can lead to inconsistent data.
*   **Redundant Analysis Trigger:** Potential double processing for suggestion analysis on manual checkups.
*   **Potential Race Condition:** Suggestion analysis event emitted *before* checkup DB save completes.
*   **Error Handling Gaps:** Needs comprehensive review, especially for multi-step operations and user feedback.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions
*   **Daily Review Navigation:** Confirmed that daily entry generation leads back to `/journal.tsx`.
*   **Daily Review UX:** The two-pane layout in `app/journal.tsx` separates navigation and content display, aiming for a desktop-like experience.

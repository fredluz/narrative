# Product Context: Narrative

## 1. Problem Space
Users often struggle to maintain momentum on long-term goals and connect daily tasks to their larger aspirations. Additionally, integrating meaningful self-reflection into a busy schedule can be challenging. Existing productivity tools might focus heavily on task management or journaling, but rarely integrate both seamlessly with AI-driven insights.

## 2. Solution
Narrative provides an integrated platform where users can:
*   Define high-level goals (Quests).
*   Break Quests into manageable daily tasks.
*   Log journal entries (checkups) throughout the day, either manually or automatically generated from AI chat interactions.
*   Receive AI-powered feedback and analysis on their journal entries to foster self-awareness.
*   Engage with a personalized AI assistant for motivation, task management, and guided reflection.
*   Review daily progress and reflections in a consolidated end-of-day summary.

## 3. How it Works (User Perspective)
1.  **Setup:** User signs up, potentially chooses an initial AI personality and theme.
2.  **Goal Setting:** User defines Quests (e.g., "Learn Guitar", "Improve Fitness").
3.  **Task Planning:** User creates tasks related to their Quests or standalone tasks for the day/week.
4.  **Daily Interaction:**
    *   User works on tasks, updating their status (e.g., using a Kanban board or list).
    *   User interacts with the AI Chat assistant for help, motivation, or just conversation.
    *   User manually adds quick journal checkups via the Journal Panel, reflecting on moments, feelings, or progress.
5.  **Automatic Journaling:** After a chat session, the system automatically generates a journal checkup summarizing the user's side of the conversation.
6.  **AI Feedback:** The system analyzes individual checkups (manual or automatic) and provides brief AI responses/insights.
7.  **Daily Review:** At the end of the day (or triggered manually), the system compiles all checkups and potentially task progress into a daily summary/analysis.
8.  **Suggestions:** Throughout the process, the AI might proactively suggest relevant tasks, reflection prompts, or identify potential patterns/blockers.

## 4. User Experience Goals
*   **Seamless Integration:** Task management and journaling should feel like two sides of the same coin, not separate modules.
*   **Motivational & Supportive:** The AI interactions and feedback should be encouraging and helpful.
*   **Insightful:** The journaling and analysis features should promote genuine self-reflection and awareness.
*   **Flexible:** Users should be able to use the features that best suit their workflow (e.g., focus on tasks, journaling, or both).
*   **Personalized:** Theme and AI personality choices should make the experience feel unique to the user.
*   **Low Friction:** Adding journal entries and managing tasks should be quick and easy.
